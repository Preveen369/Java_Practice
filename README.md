# Java Practice
Java Practice is a comprehensive repository of Java code examples, demos, and explanatory Markdown files designed for learners to master core Java concepts. It covers everything from foundational programming basics to advanced topics like the Collections Framework, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), serialization, generics, and modern Java features. Each section includes runnable demos and detailed concept overviews to facilitate hands-on learning and experimentation.

## 🚀 Features
- 🏗️ **Java Basics**: Essential building blocks including data types, operators (arithmetic, logical, relational), control structures (loops, conditionals, switch), and introductory examples like Hello World. [Explore Basics Concepts](https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice/blob/main/Java_Basics_Codes/Basics%20Concepts.md).
- 📚 **Collections Framework**: Dynamic data structures such as Vectors, ArrayLists, Sets, Maps, with sorting, streaming APIs, generics, and custom serialization demos. [Explore Collections Concepts](https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice/blob/main/Java_Collections_Codes/Collections%20Concepts.md) | [Serialization Dates Concept](https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice/blob/main/Java_Collections_Codes/Serialization%20Dates%20Concept.md).
- 🔄 **OOPS Principles**: Full coverage of classes/objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, method overriding/overloading, anonymous classes, and cloning. [Explore OOPS Concepts](https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice/blob/main/Java_OOPS_Codes/OOPS%20concepts.md).
- 📝 **Advanced Topics**: Sealed classes, records, lambda expressions (LVTI), file I/O, custom serialization, and annotations for modern Java development.
- 📖 **Concept Guides**: Markdown files explaining key ideas with code snippets, making it easy to understand theory alongside practice.
- 🧪 **Standalone Demos**: All code is modular and console-based, perfect for quick compilation and testing without complex setups.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Java** – Core language (JDK 8+ recommended) for all demos and examples
- **Standard Libraries** – Utilizes built-in packages like java.util, java.io, and java.lang for collections, I/O, and OOPS

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Explore subfolders like `Java Basics Codes`, `Java Collections Codes`, or `Java OOPS Codes` to find relevant .java files and .md concept guides.
2. Read the Markdown file in a section (e.g., [Basics Concepts.md](https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice/blob/main/Java_Basics_Codes/Basics%20Concepts.md)) for theory, then jump to demo files for practical implementation.
3. Edit a .java file to customize (e.g., change loop limits or add elements to a collection), compile it, and run to see outputs in the console.
4. Use VS Code or any IDE for syntax highlighting and easy execution; files are self-contained with main methods.
5. Experiment with advanced features like serialization by running demos that save/load objects to files.

## 🧪 Setup & Installation
### 📋 Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or higher installed
- A code editor like VS Code with Java extensions, or command-line access

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preveen369/Java_Practice.git
cd Java_Practice
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Steps to run
1. **Navigate to a subfolder** (e.g., `cd "Java Basics Codes"`).
2. **Compile a demo** (e.g., `javac Hello.java`).
3. **Run it** (e.g., `java Hello`).
   
For IDEs like VS Code: Open the folder, right-click a .java file, and select "Run Java" to execute directly. No additional dependencies or builds needed—dive in and code!
